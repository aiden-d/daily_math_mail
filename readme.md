# Description

This project contains a simple mailer script which can be used to send a question at a desired frequency to a list of users.

The concept of spaced-repetition, where a user re-exposes themselves to concepts over an iteratively spaced timeline, is highly regarded in the revision literature. Please feel free to read up more on it (see [this](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2372732215624708) and [this](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1815156116)).

# Workings

Images of questions can be imported into here using a variety of tools (check out my other repos) and are stored in  the `images/` directory. The index.txt file contains the category of each question, used in the email description.
